/// A wrapper for `&[u8]` that provides convenient string oriented trait impls.
///
/// If you need ownership or a growable byte string buffer, then use
/// [`BString`](struct.BString.html).
///
/// Using a `&BStr` is just like using a `&[u8]`, since `BStr`
/// implements `Deref` to `[u8]`. So all methods available on `[u8]`
/// are also available on `BStr`.
///
/// # Representation
///
/// A `&BStr` has the same representation as a `&str`. That is, a `&BStr` is
/// a fat pointer which consists of a pointer to some bytes and a length.
///
/// # Trait implementations
///
/// The `BStr` type has a number of trait implementations, and in particular,
/// defines equality and ordinal comparisons between `&BStr`, `&str` and
/// `&[u8]` for convenience.
///
/// The `Debug` implementation for `BStr` shows its bytes as a normal string.
/// For invalid UTF-8, hex escape sequences are used.
///
/// The `Display` implementation behaves as if `BStr` were first lossily
/// converted to a `str`. Invalid UTF-8 bytes are substituted with the Unicode
/// replacement codepoint, which looks like this: ï¿½.
